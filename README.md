# synergv-lib
Javascript Google Voice API

To use:

This is currently browser-only code

npm install --save ericblade/synergv-lib

then you can import it as an ES6 module.  You can probably require it as a node module as well,
but the code won't currently work in node.  (I hope to figure that out in the future)


Warning: I sprinkle my code with tons and tons and tons of // TODO notes.
These are things that I think of while I'm writing code.  I might not ever get to them, or I
might decide they are a super priority. :-)

// TODO: Figure out a way to get this to properly checkout from github.  Do we just need to
// add the "dist" dir to the repo?  Can we get "npm install" to checkout the source and run the
// build command automatically?  These are things that I do not know the answer to, and I will
// need to either research, or rely on those with more experience using ES6 source in places where
// it doesn't normally belong. :-)

/// I also have no idea how to format .md files.
